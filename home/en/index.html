            <h2>Welcome to Hiraku</h2>

            <p>
                Our textbook embraces a unique approach to learning, fostering collaboration between Japanese and
                English learners. Rooted
                in the philosophy of service learning, Hiraku offers an innovative way for learners to grow together.
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagine you're studying Japanese at a university in the U.S. In class, you're mastering hiragana,
                katakana, and kanji, along with
                grammar and pronunciation. Beyond the classroom, you're immersing yourself in Japanese media, absorbing
                the language firsthand. But
                there's more to learn. You're curious about real-life usage: When and how do native speakers use
                phrases? Can you express yourself
                more naturally in Japanese? You crave authentic communication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Likewise, Japanese students learning English seek the same authenticity. They long to understand how
                English is used in everyday
                life in the U.S. They're eager to converse fluently, just as you are in Japanese.
            </p>

            <p>
