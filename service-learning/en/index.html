        <h2>What is Service learning?</h2>

        <p>
            Service Learning is all about learning while making a difference in our communities. It's a hands-on approach where we 
            share what we know while also learning from the people we're helping. In this language learning textbook, "Hiraku," we 
            apply this idea to learning languages. You work with a Japanese native to improve your Japanese, while they enhance their 
            English, creating a mutual learning experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            In service learning, we follow a simple cycle: prepare, exchange, then reflect on what we've learned. In "Hiraku," you'll 
            do the same. Before each session, get ready, then dive into the activities with your language partner. Afterward, take some 
            time to think about what you've discovered and jot down your thoughts in the "Memo & Reflection" section. You can write 
            about anything that stands out to you, whether it's what you've learned, questions you have, or experiences you've shared 
            with your study buddy. Through this process, you'll not only improve your language skills but also grow personally and 
            become more involved in your community.
